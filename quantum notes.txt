- We are doing quantum connect 4, see overleaf for the rules
- We can augment the project using the follow options:
	- Theory behind quantum games, lots of research available in this area
	- Error correction in connect 4 to see if we can make it more reliable on 		physical hardware
	- Formally proving that every turn based quantum game using a certain set of mechanics can be simulated on a classical computer using the right datastructures (queue / exponential tree)


2 approaches:
- turn it into ``quantum'' game which is not easily classically simulatable
	- density matrix off-diagonal component? how affected by move
	- circuit, some gates, pi/2 gate, pi gate, how do moves translate to these  games
- approach where quantum is more efficient?

- not every conditional operation is quantum -> how can we use entanglement more than conditional move

- exponential requires exponential user input

- how is 00 + 11 different from conditional?
	- bell experiment settles the debate
	- measuring along 1 basis does not allow for classical/quantum correlation
	- using 3 bases joint correlation beast classical

- interference type move?
	- 

- measuring along different bases gives more correlation
	- 1 axis for color
	- 1 axis for taken at all

- with a 2 qubit gate there can be a phase acquired on the conditional qubit
